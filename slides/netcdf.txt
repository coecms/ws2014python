Introduction to netCDF
======================


What is netCDF
==============

A **net**\ work **C**\ ommon **D**\ ata **F**\ orm

Binary gridded data format with the following goals:

* Platform-independent

* Self-describing

* Readable across networks

* Good API for C, C++, Fortran, Java

* Outside support for other languages: Python, Ruby, Perl, etc

* Finish this


Basic Format
============

* Dimensions

  - Fixed
  - Unlimited

* Variables

  - Mapped to a tuple of dimensions

* Attributes

  - Global (file) or variable
  - Strings, integers, floats, etc.
  - Some have significant meaning


netCDF3 vs netCDF4
==================

* Latest version: 4.3.2 (?)

* netCDF3

  - Up to one unlimited dimension
  - Strong API Fortran
  - Default 2GiB file size limit (32-bit file type)

* netCDF4

  - Based on HDF5 (generic data format)
  - More than one unlimited dimension possible
  - Full 64-bit support, no more file limit (for now)
  - Evolving
