Introduction to netCDF
======================


What is netCDF
==============

A **net**\ work **C**\ ommon **D**\ ata **F**\ orm

Binary gridded data format with the following goals:

* Platform-independent

* Self-describing

* Readable across networks

* Good API for C, C++, Fortran, Java


Basic Structure
===============

Three basic components:

Dimensions
   Sizes of each dimension axis (even "unlimited")

Variables
   Numerical data and its shape (based on Dimensions)

Attributes
   Metadata describing contents


netCDF formats
==============

``NETCDF4``
   Standard, fully featured format

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Up to one unlimited dimension
  - Strong API Fortran
  - Default 2GiB file size limit (32-bit file type)
=======
``NETCDF4_CLASSIC``
   like netCDF4, but only netCDF3-compatible features are included

``NETCDF3_64BIT``
   Older netCDF3 format, but with >2GiB support

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Based on HDF5 (generic data format)
  - More than one unlimited dimension possible
  - Full 64-bit support, no more file limit (for now)
  - Evolving
=======
``NETCDF3_CLASSIC``
   Standard 32-bit netCDF3 format. 2GiB file size limit.
